                    The importance of music within games and film cannot be emphasized enough. Original soundtracks are expertly crafted to be out of the way in the viewer's perspective until crucial momentsâ€”when they underscore pivotal moments and refine the emotions felt by the viewer.

                    Since 2021 I've composed instrumental game tracks on-and-off for small developers on Roblox. I specialize in orchestral and instrumental tracks for a variety of musical roles in your game. I can compose for ambience, for action, and across a broad spectrum of emotions. I can compose music across a variety of Western historical styles, from 18th century baroque all the way to modern day orchestral work, and anything in between.
