## Thanks
Thanks to [Astro](https://astro.build/) for making such a clean framework for static site development. I commend its integrability with other web development tools, like React and Tailwind CSS. I also commend its superb documentation. It is a framework I highly recommend.

Thanks to [@ppebb](https://www.github.com/ppebb) for putting up with me constantly asking for help configuring my webserver. This is the first time I've self-hosted a website and I learned a lot.
