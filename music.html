                    <p>Since 2021 I've composed instrumental game tracks on-and-off for small developers on Roblox. Unfortunately, most of the projects I worked for later died during development, so my work never saw publicity :(.</p>
                    <p>I specialize in orchestral and instrumental tracks for a variety of musical roles in your game. I can compose for ambience, for action, and across a broad spectrum of emotions. I can compose music across a variety of Western historical styles, from 18th century baroque all the way to modern day orchestral work, and anything in between.</p>
                    <p>Besides composing, I've also arranged music for different ensembles for a long time. The bulk of my arrangements can be found at <a href="https://musescore.com/user/29251244" target="_blank">my Musescore</a>.</p>

                    <p>Feel free to contact me regarding any of your game development music needs, or if you have questions! My points of contact are listed <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">here</a>, but to save your time, my primary business email is <a href="mailto:smittycart127@outlook.com">smittycart127@outlook.com</a>, or you can contact me via the <a href="https://talent.roblox.com/creators/1274799070">Roblox Talent Hub (username: cartt0nn)</a> or <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/u/cartt0nn/summary">the Roblox DevForum</a>.</p>
                    <p>Pay is flexible and determined on a job-by-job, client-by-client basis. Generally, I run at $15 USD per track, preferably paid through PayPal, with discounts being applied for multiple tracks/whole soundtracks.</p>
