                    <p>I'm Carson! I'm currently a senior at Allen High School, and I thought I should get around to making myself a website to display my projects and professional contact.</p>
                    <p>It's a little empty right now... that's because I only recently decided to switch my prospects from financial analysis to computer and data science! I have a lot of catching up to do portfolio-wise, but I've been learning and making progress. Outside of rapdily teaching myself a plethora of CS stuff, I play the violin in my school orchestra as well as playing solo repertoire. With what free time remains, I do some casual gaming, mostly on Roblox or Minecraft because my computer is not very powerful :(</p>
                    <p>As well as being a hobby programmer, I also compose music for small game developers. Some of my sample tracks can be found on my <a href="music.html" target="_blank">Music Projects</a> page.</p>
                    <p>If you'd like, take a look around! This site will be always growing with new projects, and I've been meaning to start blogging my work on my projects. If you have any suggestions for the website, shoot them my way! I don't ever really use HTML or CSS and I just learned the basics to make this site.</p>
