                    <p>I'm Carson! I'm currently a junior at Allen High School, and I thought I should get around to making myself a website to display my projects and professional contact.</p>
                    <p>It's a little empty right now... that's because I only recently decided to switch my prospects from financial analysis to computer and data science! I have a lot of catching up to do portfolio-wise, but I've been learning and making progress. Outside of rapdily teaching myself a plethora of CS stuff, I play the violin in my school orchestra as well as with solo repertoire. With what free time remains, I do some casual gaming, mostly on Roblox or Minecraft because my computer is not very powerful :(</p>
                    <p>If you'd like, take a look around! This site will be always growing with new projects, and I've been meaning to start blogging my work on my projects. If you have any suggestions for the website, shoot them my way! I don't ever really use HTML or CSS and I just learned the basics to make this site.</p>
